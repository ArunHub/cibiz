                    <h3><strong>Refined Oil</strong></h3>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Cooking oil manufacture involves, grinding the seeds, pressing, and extruding the oil from them. In extracting, a volatile hydrocarbon such as hexane is used as a solvent. Ninety percent of the solvent remaining in the extracted oil simply evaporates, and, the rest is retrieved with the use of a stripping column. The oil is boiled by steam, and the lighter hexane floats upward. As it condenses, it is collected.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> After extracting, the oil is refined, to remove color, odour. Refining consists of heating the oil to between <strong>107 and 188 degrees Fahrenheit</strong> and mixing an alkaline substance such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate with it. Soap forms from the fatty acids and the alkaline additive, and it is usually removed by centrifuge. The oil is further washed to remove traces of soap and then dried. Further washing and refining follows, and then the oil is filtered and/or distilled. </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Oils are also degummed at this time by treating them with water heated to between <strong>188 and 206 degrees Fahrenheit</strong>, steam, or water with acid. The gums, most of which are phosphatides, precipitate out, and the dregs are removed by centrifuge.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Oil that will be heated (for use in cooking) is then bleached by filtering it through fuller's earth, activated carbon, or activated clays that absorb certain pigmented material from the oil. </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Finally, the oil is deodorized. In this process, steam is passed over hot oil in a vacuum at between <strong>440 and 485 degrees Fahrenheit</strong> , thus allowing the volatile taste and odour components to distil from the oil. Typically, citric acid at .01 percent is also added to oil after deodorization to inactivate trace metals that might promote oxidation within the oil and hence shorten its shelf-life.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> It is then ready for packaging.</p>

                    <h3><strong class="cibifont">Cibiz N<sup>2</sup> Cold Pressed Oil</strong></h3>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> The cold processed oil extraction has not been defined. Traditional extraction using wooden mortars & pestle were not in practice in North America & Europe, where seeds were roasted and beaten into a paste before being boiled in water; the oil that rose to the surface was then skimmed off.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Over time, extracting vegetable oils has become more and more efficient. Extraction through expellers operate on a mechanical press principle within the room temperature (<strong>40-70 Fahrenheit</strong>) were called as cold pressed.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> India is using the same technology for oil extraction now. Being a tropical country, the temperature is ranging between 80-120 Fahrenheit. The expellers with its iron parts further raises its temperature due to frictions and the extraction is done in a temperature around <strong>180-220 Fahrenheit</strong>. So, calling this extraction as cold pressed, is a misnomer.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span><strong class="cibifont">Cibiz N<sup>2</sup> Natural Nutrition Cold Pressed Sesame Oil</strong> is extracted following a rich heritage cold process that originated thousands of years from India, by using <strong>wooden mortar and pestle (Maram chekku/Khacha Ghani)</strong>, an all natural way to extract oil retaining all its nutrition.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Oil is cold-pressed in small batches at controlled low temperatures such that it is more resistant to heat than any other oil. The extraction is then slightly filtered to remove sediments, before being bottled.</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> Being an end to end natural extraction process, there is no use of any refining, bleaching, or deodorizing agent.</p>
                    <p><strong><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tint"></span> The oil thus retains its original unique aroma, rich flavour & colour and all its nutritional value
